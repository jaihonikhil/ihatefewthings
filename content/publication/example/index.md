abstract: This paper describes a robust autonomous disinfection tunnel to disinfect external surfaces of COVID-19 virus such as clothes and open body sections in public places such as airports, office complexes, schools, and malls. To make the tunnel effective and highly efficient, it has been provided with two chambers with three disinfection processes. Due to the multiple processes, the possibility of neutralizing the virus is quite high and higher than other solutions available at this point for this purpose. Chamber 1 sprays the solution of a disinfectant on the person. This solution can be either a dilute solution of approved chemical or any Ayurvedic/herbal disinfectant. Once the person enters chamber 2, he/she is exposed to hot air at 70 °C along with far-ultraviolet C rays (207–222 nm). Both chambers function autonomously by detecting a person in a chamber using ultrasonic sensors. The proposed tunnel is developed under industry–academia collaboration jointly by Technopark@iitk and ALIMCO under the ambit of the Ministry of Human Resources Development and the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, respectively. The tunnel is referred to as the ‘Techno Advanced Disinfection Tunnel’ (TADT).

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper discusses the design and development of a fully automatic, modular, and portable tunnel that has two chambers and uses three processes to disinfect people with high neutralizing efficiency of the COVID-19 virus. In the first chamber, the person is disinfected by the  spraying of the ionized mist of an approved disinfectant solution for 20 s. The electrostatic nozzles used in the chamber produce ultra-fine droplets of size < 30 microns allowing minimal use of a disinfectant. In the second chamber, the person is exposed to hot air for approximately 20 s and a safe wavelength of far-UVC radiations for 15 s simultaneously. All these processes are performed autonomously, where the presence of a person is detected using ultrasonic sensors. This ‘Techno Advanced Disinfection Tunnel’ is successfully developed under industry–academia collaboration at IIT Kanpur. This work can be extended to mobile disinfection tunnels for vehicles/two-wheelers and for lightweight chambers at airports, schools, and office complexes, once India reopens its economy.
