I am a third year undergrad at IIT Kanpur in the Mechanical Department.My interests though are in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Data Science, Robotics and Electronics.I have been fortunate enough to work with amazing Professors at IIT Kanpur, seniors and batchmates.I am very fond of singing as well. It was during my JEE days that I started exploring other religions and slowly drifted towards a mixture of Hinduism and Buddhism as a way of life.

Along with this, I like pitching my ideas as well in various competitions. The entire idea of how technology can change the world inspires me to explore the various skills so as to understand it better. I have also been working towards mental health for quite a while. Currently I am part of the Core team body of Counselling Service, IITK which looks after the academics and mental well being of the campus people. Overall I am a person with curiosity, a lot of dreams and willingness to learn.
